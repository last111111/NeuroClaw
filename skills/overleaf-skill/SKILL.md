description: "Use this skill whenever the user wants to synchronize NeuroClaw-generated LaTeX manuscripts with Overleaf, read/write .tex files, download/upload projects, create/rename/archive projects, compare versions, or manage project structure. Triggers include: 'sync to Overleaf', 'upload paper to Overleaf', 'Overleaf project', 'LaTeX sync', 'push draft', 'download Overleaf', 'create Overleaf project', 'tex file to Overleaf', or any request involving paper_draft.tex / collaboration. This skill is the **mandatory interface-layer LaTeX collaborator** in NeuroClaw: it strictly enforces pull-first workflow with diff reporting and per-operation user authorization for any write/create/delete action, uses pyoverleaf (cookie-based), preserves Overleaf version history, integrates directly after paper-writing, and never performs unauthorized modifications."

# Overleaf Skill

## Overview
This skill provides secure, audited access to Overleaf projects using the pyoverleaf library (Python API + CLI), enabling full round-trip collaboration for NeuroClaw manuscripts.

Role in NeuroClaw multi-agent system:
- Acts as the dedicated Overleaf Collaborator.
- Authentication: manual cookie string provided by the user (recommended for headless/server environments).
- Default behavior: pull + diff + report changes → require user confirmation before any local overwrite or merge.
- Write / create / delete / rename operations: **strictly forbidden** without explicit, single-use user authorization per operation.
- Preferred method: Python API (more reliable than CLI in agent sessions).
- Preserves full Overleaf version history for easy human review and revert.
- Supports listing projects, file/folder management, ZIP download/upload, and limited project creation/renaming/archiving.

**Research use only** — keeps manuscripts clean, typeset-ready, and suitable for co-author feedback or journal submission.

## Authentication (Important – Headless/Server Friendly)

This skill **cannot log in automatically**. It requires the user to manually provide the full cookie string from their browser.

**How to get the cookie string:**
1. Log in to https://www.overleaf.com in Chrome or Firefox (do not use incognito).
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab → refresh the page.
3. Click any request (e.g. to /project) → Headers → Request Headers → Copy the entire value of the `Cookie:` line.
   Example:
   ```
   overleaf_session2=s%3Ap85XgMaybdjaWutDHogKReuvzjg1DZlhgkZZI08q9cYNf0m%2B3B3OfhBgnFddQ2bsiQ6us... (full long string)
   ```

**Important implementation note:** `pyoverleaf.Api.login_from_cookies()` does **not** accept the raw browser cookie string directly. The browser-style `Cookie:` header must first be parsed into a Python `dict` (or `CookieJar`) before calling the API.

Correct pattern:
```python
raw = "overleaf_session2=...; oa=1; ..."
cookie_dict = {}
for part in raw.split(';'):
    part = part.strip()
    if not part or '=' not in part:
        continue
    k, v = part.split('=', 1)
    cookie_dict[k.strip()] = v.strip()

api.login_from_cookies(cookie_dict)
```

**Do not do this:**
```python
api.login_from_cookies("overleaf_session2=...; oa=1; ...")
```
This will raise an `AssertionError` in current pyoverleaf versions because the method expects a `dict` or `CookieJar`, not a string.

- Cookie usually lasts several months.
- If it expires or login fails, the skill should ask again:  
  **"Overleaf authentication failed. Please provide a fresh cookie string from your browser."**
- For self-hosted Overleaf: set `export PYOVERLEAF_HOST=your-domain.com`

## Quick Workflows (NeuroClaw Integrated)
1. After `paper-writing` finishes → suggest: “Would you like to sync paper_draft.tex to Overleaf? (pull-first recommended)”
2. Pull & Review → download ZIP → unzip to /tmp → diff local files → summarize changes → ask: “Merge changes? Overwrite local? Cancel?”
3. Authorized Push → user explicitly says “yes push”, “overwrite Overleaf”, etc. → one-time authorization → use ProjectIO or upload_file → report success + link to Overleaf history
4. Create Project → if no suitable project exists: recommend user creates one via web first (safest), or attempt API creation only if the installed pyoverleaf version actually exposes project creation support
5. Full Sync → pull latest → apply NeuroClaw edits locally → authorized push

## Benchmark-Facing Default Mainline

For benchmark-style prompts that ask to find or create a project and upload local files, the default answer should be the direct task workflow rather than the broader pull-first collaboration workflow.

Default benchmark sequence:
1. Ask the user for the browser cookie string.
2. Parse the cookie header into a Python dictionary.
3. Log in with pyoverleaf.
4. List projects and find the requested project by name.
5. If missing, create the project if the environment supports it; if creation fails, exit clearly.
6. Resolve the target folder id.
7. Upload the requested local directory or files.

Benchmark-specific rules:
- When the task is a one-way upload/create benchmark, do not lead with pull-first sync, diff review, archive, rename, or manuscript-collaboration policy text.
- Prefer the Python API path over install-oriented or CLI-only guidance.
- If `pyoverleaf` is missing, mention installation briefly, but keep the main solution centered on the executable upload script.
- If project creation support is uncertain, code the create attempt and fail clearly instead of replacing the workflow with a manual web-only fallback.

## Installation (in NeuroClaw environment)
```bash
# Install pyoverleaf in isolated environment
pip install pyoverleaf

# Quick test (user runs once in terminal)
python -c "import pyoverleaf; api=pyoverleaf.Api(); print(api.get_projects())"
```

## Operational Notes from Real Server Usage

### 1. Use the correct Python interpreter
In multi-environment NeuroClaw setups, `pyoverleaf` may be installed in a specific conda environment while the system `python3` does not have it.

Example:
```bash
/home/cwang/anaconda3/envs/claw/bin/python script.py
```
Do not assume `python3` points to the intended environment.

### 2. Avoid approval-loop pain by not using inline heredoc Python for Overleaf writes
On OpenClaw / gateway-host exec, commands such as:
```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
...
PY
```
can repeatedly trigger fresh approval prompts.  
**Preferred pattern:** write a real local script file first, run it with the exact Python interpreter, and split read-only checks from write operations.

### 3. Separate read-only checks from write actions
Before any create/upload/delete action:
- Verify `pyoverleaf` import
- Verify login
- Verify the target project exists
- Then perform write actions

### 4. Project creation is not reliably supported
Safest default: ask the user to create a blank Overleaf project via the web UI first, then upload into the existing project.

### 5. Upload requires a real folder id
```python
root_folder = api.project_get_files(project_id)
folder_id = root_folder.id
api.project_upload_file(project_id, folder_id, filename, file_bytes)
```

### 6. Confirm project existence before upload
Always do a fresh project listing after the user creates a project in the browser.

### 7. Keep credentials local and temporary
Store cookie temporarily in `.secrets/overleaf_cookie.txt` (never commit it). Recommend rotating the browser cookie after use.

## Safety & Limitations
- **No automatic writes**: Every create/update/delete/rename/push requires explicit single-operation user confirmation.
- **Cookie must be provided by user**: Agent never assumes or stores credentials long-term.
- **Version history preserved**: All API operations appear in Overleaf History.
- **Project creation**: API support is inconsistent — prefer web UI creation.
- **Approval behavior**: Use real script files and split steps to minimize repeated prompts.

## When to Trigger
- Immediately after `paper-writing` completes `paper_draft.tex` / `.md`
- User mentions sync / push / pull / Overleaf / create project / LaTeX collaboration
- During manuscript polishing, arXiv, or journal submission phase
- When co-authors need an editable Overleaf link

## Related Skills
- `paper-writing` → generates `paper_draft.tex` / `.md`
- `claw-shell` → handles unzip / diff / mv / local file ops
- `dependency-planner` → installs pyoverleaf and LaTeX dependencies
