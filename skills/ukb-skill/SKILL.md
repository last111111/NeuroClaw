# UKB Skill (Analysis Layer)

## Overview

`ukb-skill` is the NeuroClaw **analysis-layer** skill for **brain-focused UK Biobank downstream research**.

This skill is designed for users who already have local UK Biobank tables, derived phenotype tables, or neuroimaging-derived feature matrices and want to run downstream statistical or machine learning analyses.

It follows the NeuroClaw hierarchical design principles:
- This skill describes **WHAT needs to be analyzed** and **which existing skill should handle each part**.
- It contains **no RAP download workflow** and **no cloud export instructions**.
- It contains **no direct implementation code** and **no direct shell commands**.
- All concrete execution should be delegated through `claw-shell` and related downstream skills.

**Core workflow (never bypassed):**
1. Confirm that the user already has accessible UK Biobank-derived local data.
2. Identify the research target: neurological endpoint, cognitive phenotype, brain MRI phenotype, or predictive modeling task.
3. Identify the analysis type: regression, survival analysis, subgroup analysis, propensity score analysis, mediation analysis, sensitivity analysis, machine learning, visualization, or manuscript support.
4. Check the minimum required columns, files, and assumptions.
5. Generate a **numbered execution plan** with outputs, delegated skills, and risks.
6. Present the plan and wait for explicit user confirmation ("YES" / "execute" / "proceed").
7. On confirmation, delegate all execution through `claw-shell` and the target skills.

**Research use only.**

## Benchmark-Facing Default Mainline

For benchmark-style prompts, choose the narrowest valid UK Biobank brain-analysis route first and do not widen the response into unrelated epidemiology branches.

- If the task is incident neurological disease modeling:
   - Default to `analysis-ready table -> survival endpoint check -> Cox regression -> sensitivity analysis if requested -> result summary`.
   - Do not expand into unrelated imaging preprocessing or data download steps.
- If the task is cross-sectional cognition or brain-phenotype association analysis:
   - Default to `feature table -> covariate check -> linear/logistic regression -> ranked outputs -> visualization if requested`.
   - Do not expand into unrelated survival analysis unless the prompt explicitly asks for incident-event modeling.
- If the task is predictive modeling on brain-related UKB features:
   - Default to `clean feature matrix -> train/validation split -> model fitting -> metrics -> interpretation`.
   - Delegate predictive modeling to `run_models` when appropriate.
- If required columns or files are missing:
   - State `Missing required input` explicitly.
   - Do not invent UKB field names, event dates, or covariates.
- Do not introduce RAP, cloud export, or downloader guidance in benchmark mode.

When multiple valid analysis routes exist, prefer one explicit mainline plus a short note about blocked optional branches.

**Research use only.**

## Quick Reference (Common UKB Brain Tasks → Delegation Map)

| Task | What needs to be done (high level) | Delegate to which skill | Expected outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neurological survival analysis | Validate incident-event table, define endpoint, run Cox regression, summarize hazard ratios | `claw-shell` | model summaries, hazard ratio tables, survival outputs |
| Cognitive phenotype association | Regress cognition or brain-health phenotype on exposure or imaging features | `claw-shell` | beta/OR tables, cleaned regression outputs |
| Brain MRI phenotype association | Analyze ROI volumes, cortical thickness, WMH burden, diffusion or connectivity summaries | `claw-shell` | ranked effect tables, feature association summaries |
| Predictive modeling on UKB brain features | Fit classification or regression models and interpret them | `run_models` | metrics, predictions, SHAP summaries, model comparisons |
| Subgroup analysis | Test heterogeneity by sex, age band, APOE, vascular risk, or other subgroup | `claw-shell` | subgroup effect tables, interaction summaries |
| Propensity score analysis | Estimate propensity scores, run matching or weighting, assess balance | `claw-shell` | matched/weighted dataset summaries, balance outputs |
| Mediation analysis | Test whether a biomarker or imaging phenotype mediates a brain-related outcome | `claw-shell` | direct/indirect effect summaries, mediation tables |
| Sensitivity analysis | Exclude early events or rows with missing covariates, then rerun the same model | `claw-shell` | sensitivity tables, robustness comparison summaries |
| Brain-result visualization | Turn ranked brain-region or connectome outputs into figures | `brain-visualization` | PNG figures, ranked region tables, connectome plots |
| Manuscript-ready methods/results | Convert the finished analysis into text for reports or papers | `paper-writing` | draft methods, results text, figure legends |

## Recommended Strategy (Decision Logic)

- If the goal is **incident neurological disease analysis** such as dementia, stroke, or Parkinson's disease:
   - Prefer the survival-analysis route.
   - Confirm prevalent vs incident definition, censoring rule, and time/status columns before modeling.
   - Best for: longitudinal UKB outcome studies.

- If the goal is **cross-sectional cognition or brain-health association analysis**:
   - Prefer linear or logistic regression on a cleaned participant-level table.
   - Best for: baseline phenotype studies, association screens, cognition analyses.

- If the goal is **brain MRI phenotype association analysis** using ROI tables, cortical thickness, WMH burden, diffusion summaries, or connectome summaries:
   - Prefer a feature-table association route.
   - Best for: imaging-derived phenotype studies and region-wise effect ranking.

- If the goal is **predictive modeling** on UKB brain-related features:
   - Prefer `run_models` for model fitting, model comparison, and interpretation.
   - Best for: disease risk prediction, cognitive outcome prediction, multimodal tabular modeling.

- If the goal is **effect heterogeneity or causal approximation**:
   - Prefer subgroup, propensity score, or mediation workflows.
   - Best for: mechanistic analyses, treatment/exposure comparison, robustness studies.

- If the goal is **publication-ready figures or writing**:
   - Prefer `brain-visualization` for figures and `paper-writing` for text output.
   - Best for: reporting, paper drafting, slide-ready summaries.

## Minimal Input Requirements

### For Survival Analysis
- participant ID column
- survival time or baseline and event/censoring dates
- event indicator/status column
- clearly defined neurological or brain-related outcome
- covariates

### For Cross-Sectional Regression
- participant ID column
- exposure or predictor columns
- target phenotype column
- covariates

### For Brain Feature Modeling
- participant ID column
- ROI / IDP / derived feature columns
- target phenotype or outcome
- optional scanner, site, or confound columns

If the required inputs are not present, return a concrete missing-input list instead of inventing fields.

## Brain-Relevant UKB Targets

This skill is intentionally restricted to brain-related UK Biobank content. Typical targets include:
- neurodegenerative outcomes: dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease
- cerebrovascular outcomes: stroke and vascular brain-health outcomes
- cognition: memory, reaction time, executive function, fluid intelligence, cognitive decline
- psychiatric or brain-health outcomes when explicitly tied to brain-focused analysis
- imaging-derived brain phenotypes: cortical thickness, regional volume, subcortical volume, WMH burden, diffusion metrics, functional connectivity summaries

If the request is mainly non-brain UK Biobank epidemiology, this skill should state that it is out of scope.

---

## When to Call This Skill

- Any request involving UK Biobank brain-related downstream analysis on already available local data.
- Any request involving dementia, stroke, cognition, brain MRI phenotypes, WMH burden, or brain-feature prediction in UKB.
- Any request asking for subgroup analysis, propensity score analysis, mediation analysis, or sensitivity analysis in a brain-focused UKB setting.

Do not call this skill for RAP export, field download, or raw neuroimaging preprocessing from DICOM/NIfTI.

## Important Notes & Limitations

- This skill assumes that the user already has legal access to UK Biobank data and has already exported or derived the needed local analysis files.
- This skill does not define fixed UKB field IDs because field selection differs across studies and exports.
- This skill should not guess disease definitions, date columns, or censoring rules when they are not provided.
- Sensitivity analysis should be framed as filtered-data reruns of the same main model, not as unrelated new pipelines.
- If multiple candidate outcomes or feature tables exist, the skill should first ask which one is primary before execution.
- This skill is intended for research workflows and not for clinical decision-making.

## Default Response Pattern

When this skill is triggered, the response should:
1. Restate the exact UK Biobank brain-related analysis goal.
2. State that the skill assumes local data is already available and does not cover downloading.
3. List the minimum required columns or files.
4. Provide a numbered execution plan.
5. State which NeuroClaw skills will be delegated to.
6. Wait for confirmation before execution.
